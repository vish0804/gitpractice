# Software Engineering

I find this article interesting because it explains what software engineering is but also states thats the specific techniques, methods, and processes used in software engineering is *not stated*, and the books never really mention them. This is the case I assume because the field of computer science is so vast, and there are so many different approaches based on different questions. I also think of software engineering a little different when the author says it is an **artifical** science, whereas physics and chemistry are **natural sciences**.
